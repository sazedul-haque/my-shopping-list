## Project Description: 
This is a chrome extension to add product to your wishlist from various e-commerce websites. This will work as your ultimate shopping list as you can add products from any e-commerce. We know every e-commerce have their own wishlist option where you can add product to buy later but there is no combine solution. You have to visit those websites separately to find those items, which is difficult to remember. So, here is the solution! Now you can add any product from any website to your shopping list and visit any time later on you want.

## How to run locally
To make this work add this extension to you chrome browser. First of all, clone the repository to your favourite directory. Then click on the right most corner button with three dots after that more tools and click on extensions option. It will open a new page with your existing extensions. If you look at the right top corner you will see a button called 'Developer mode'. Click on it. It will give you option to add extension from local PC. Click on the 'Load unpacked' button from left top corner and select the directory you cloned on. This should add the extension to your browser.

## How to use the extension
Now, visit your favourite e-commerce website. Click on a product and go to detail page. After that, click on the shopping beg icon from top right corner of your browser. It will show a popup where you will find a green button saying 'Add this product to shopping list'. Click on the button. The product will be added to your shopping list. You can visit the product page any time you want by clicking on the title. You can also delete it from your shopping list by clicking red delete button.

## Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- Chrome extension APIs

## Possible improvements:
- Now any URL can be added to shopping list. This can be restricted to only product details pages.
- If lots of items added it is difficult to navigate. So, a different page can be added to display the product.
- Product price is not included currently which also can be added.
